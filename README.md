# GBC-based serendipity functions of any order over arbitrary polygons

This is a WIP repository for the code used in the master's thesis "GBC-based serendipity functions of any order over arbitrary polygons". This readme is to be changed as well.

Not all the code here has been properly commentated. It will be polished up in the future.

Run the scripts `polygonTest.m` or `polygonPreset.m` in order to run the code. The former will let you draw a polygon for the definition of serendipity coordinates and the latter will define them over a preset polygon of choice. Change the type of coordinates to be defined over the polygon in `Serendipity.m`.
